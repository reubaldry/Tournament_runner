# Tournament_runner

## Disclaimer

Most of this was done by ChatGPT as I couldn't be bothered to it myself aside
from checking that it actually works properly. I know it runs on MacOS, and
it should run on Linux, but I can't confirm. It is also quite slow, so don't
worry if it seems to be taking a while. There is no impact on engine timeouts.

## Running

To run, first change the permissions of the file to make it executable.
Then run `./tournament_runner.py`.

Optional arguments are number of tournaments to run, and whether you want the
stdout from the tournament to print.

To run it 5 times, with no stdout, use `./tournament_runner.py -n 5 --no-echo`.

## Contributing

Please feel free to open a PR and contribute. Some analysis of the results
would be cool. Just pop me a message and I'll accept any changes.
